## OVERVIEW

Project Name: LUMINANCE
Data collected: 2018

Studies with experimental animals have revealed a mood-regulating neural
pathway linking intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells
(ipRGCs) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), involved in the
pathophysiology of mood disorders. Since humans also have
light-intensity-encoding ipRGCs, we investigated whether a similar
pathway exists in humans.

Dataset contains structural and functional MRI data and associated stimulus
timing files

## Methods
### Subjects
Subjects 20 healthy female and male participants from the local Providence, RI
community (age 20-30 years old; 24.3 ± 3.7 years, mean ± s.d.).

Participants underwent five runs of six minutes each during a single
scan session. Each run consisted of twelve 30-second epochs of constant
light intensity divided into three consecutive groups of four. Each
group of four epochs contained all four light intensities [average
light-intensity (irradiance) across the 400-700 nm human visible
spectrum 10.2, 12.1, 13.1, and 13.8 log photons cm-2 s-1] in
pseudorandom order. These light intensities corresponded to the
following quantum catches of melanopsin: 11.5, 13.6, 14.6, and 15.2 log
photons cm-2 s-1.

Participants wore Teflon goggles that diffused the light. The light
stimulus, as reported by the participants, did not contain any patterned
visual information and covered the entire field of view. ). To ensure
alertness during the scan session, participants performed an auditory
task in which they discriminated between two presented tones (1 and 2
kHz, 100 msec duration) and indicated the perceived tone by pressing the
left button for the 1 kHz tone and the right button for the 2 kHz tone.
We recorded the time of the button press and response accuracy, finding
no difference in reaction time or accuracy across the different light
intensities.
